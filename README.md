## About

The `.env` file has several fields to explain.

- `USERNAME` - The username of the account you're connecting to
- `PASSWORD` - The password of the account you're connecting to
- `VERSION` - The version of the bot. Used for about and update messages
- `ABOUT_MESSAGE` - A message meant to introduce the bot. A new one will be sent every time the `VERSION` value in incremented
- `UPDATE_MESSAGE` - A message similar to the above field but meant to introduce new features
- `HELP_MESSAGE` - The reply given when a user asks for help
- `COOLDOWN` - The time between running actions in seconds
- `WEB_PANEL` - Whether the application opens the web control panel

For the `ABOUT_MESSAGE` and `UPDATE_MESSAGE` fields there's several placeholder keys you can use. `%u` is replaced with the `USERNAME` field, `%v` is replaced with the `VERSION` field, and `%c` is replaced with the values from the COMMANDS dictionary in `index.py`. The commands will be split by newlines except in `HELP_MESSAGE` where they will be split by commas.

The web control panel is still in progress, hence why it's recommended to be off by default. To access it you can find it at `http://localhost:7889/`
